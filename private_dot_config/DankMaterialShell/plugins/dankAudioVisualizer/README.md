# Dank Audio Visualizer

A circular audio visualizer desktop widget for [Dank Material Shell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-docs).

Ported from **[Fancy Audiovisualizer](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-plugins/tree/main/fancy-audiovisualizer)** by **Lemmy / Noctalia Team** — originally built for the Noctalia shell.

## Credits

- **Original author:** Lemmy / [Noctalia Team](https://github.com/noctalia-dev)
- **Original repository:** [noctalia-dev/noctalia-plugins](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-plugins)
- **Original license:** MIT
- **DMS port by:** [odtgit](https://github.com/odtgit)

## What changed in the port

- Adapted from Noctalia's `DraggableDesktopWidget` to DMS `DesktopPluginComponent`
- Bundled a self-contained 32-bar, 60 FPS cava process (DMS built-in CavaService only provides 6 bars)
- Added idle detection with automatic fade support
- Settings mapped to DMS `PluginSettings` components
- Theme integration switched from Noctalia `Color.*` / `Style.*` to DMS `Theme.*`
- GLSL 450 shader copied unchanged — all rendering logic is identical to the original
